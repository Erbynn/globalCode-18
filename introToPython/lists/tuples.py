# A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects.Tuples are sequences,just like lists.
# The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists
# and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.

Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values. Optionally you can put these comma-separated values between parentheses also.

tuple1 = ('name', 1, 5)
tuple2 = (1,2,3,5)

print(tuple1 + tuple2)
